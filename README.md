## User Management System
This project is a React native mobile app which allows user to log in and also register. The app is based on React Native, and the backend is Firebase Authentiacation and Firebase realtime database.


## Run the app
```
cd [project folder]
npm start
Enter 'i'
```
This app is only tested on iOS because the Android simulator for React Native is not free.
